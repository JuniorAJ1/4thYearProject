    <p>Over the Years biometrics security has become very important in security purposes. Protecting personal information is getting increasingly difficult as technology pervades every part of modern life and our society becomes increasingly computerized. Passwords and keys were long thought to be enough for data security, but they now appear to be more ineffective in the face of sophisticated hacker attacks. Passwords are, in fact, the weakest link in a company's security system. This is due to the fact that they may be shared, and even those with high entropy can be cracked using a variety of techniques. Recent stories of network security breaches and identity thefts reinforce the need for a solid authentication technique in today's world. As a result, biometric security has become a priority, as it is the only reliable way to verify an individual's identification. Biometric features are physical and behavioural characteristics that are intrinsic and unique to each individual, and include fingerprints, face, iris, stride, voice, and so on. As a result, biometric security systems can validate an individual's identity with utmost accuracy and dependability because biometric qualities are ingrained in their DNA. For this Project my Goal is to use the Biometric feature Face Recognition, to be used to aid a surveillance system. With the code I have Written home owners or Business owners, will be able to catch a live video of the house/business and with the facial recognition will help detect who was around and alert owner of any unfamiliar faces.
My Project will consist a raspberry pi and Picamera, on the Piâ€™s OS I wrote python code with the help of Opencv a library which helped with the Facial Recognition and a Flask framework which allowed me to host a webpage using python and HTML
